# odin-sign-up-form

### Description
A simple sign-up form design.

### Why I made this?
I made this following theodinproject.com. The task was to recreate a sign-up form from a given design (an image) and add validations for the inputs.

### What I learned from this?
- how to use @font-face to add a new font in my css file
- how to use :valid and :invalid to style inputs
- how to set the validity of an input using javascript
